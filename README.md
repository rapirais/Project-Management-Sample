This project was created as an optional assignment during my 6-week Virtual Assistant course at SGB. I developed a project management mock-up, taking the role of a project manager to plan a Women’s Celebration event.

I used Google Workspace tools to organize workflows, schedules, and communications. The project also includes a Gantt chart to visualize timelines, task dependencies, and progress tracking, demonstrating structured planning and effective coordination.
